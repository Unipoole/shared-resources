# shared-resources
The Shared-resources tool contains the plain old Java objects (POJOs) which are shared amongst the Unipoole projects.
Some of the POJOs also contain annotations required for the parsing Java objects into valid Javascript Object Notation  (JSON).
This is a library project and does not contain deployable artefacts.

## Building
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unipoole/shared-resources.git
cd shared-resources
mvn clean install
```
